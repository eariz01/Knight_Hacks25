        "year": 1980,
        "summary": "This seminal case established that an insurer has a duty to act in good faith and with due regard for its insured's interests, weighing the insured's interests as heavily as its own when considering settlement offers. A breach of this duty, determined by the 'totality of the circumstances,' can render the insurer liable for a judgment exceeding policy limits.",

The insurer has an affirmative duty to act in good faith and attempt to settle claims when it knows, or reasonably should know, that settlement is possible.",

An insurer's attempt to use a settlement opportunity to extract an overly broad release can constitute bad faith.",

    "notes": "The high PIP payments (exceeding $21,000) suggest significant injuries, which could make State Farm's low $3,000 settlement offer for one client, or even a $25,000 policy limit offer if it fails to reasonably resolve the claim due to release terms or prior conduct, subject to bad faith scrutiny under Florida law. The terms of the 'proposed Release' should be carefully reviewed for any overly broad or unreasonable provisions that could serve as further evidence of bad faith. Florida's bad faith jurisprudence emphasizes the insurer's affirmative duty to settle when it has the opportunity to do so, considering the insured's interests equally with its own.",
